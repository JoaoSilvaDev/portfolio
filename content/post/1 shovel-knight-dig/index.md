In Shovel Knight Dig, I delved into serious **UI programming** for the first time. **Localization** added another layer of complexity, this experience taught me the importance of considering localization from the project's inception and maintaining a clean, decoupled project structure for smoother development.

Collaborating with a skilled UI designer, I received mockups and assets, fostering a valuable feedback loop. This collaborative effort highlighted the significance of effective teamwork in game development.

In addition to tackling UI programming, I took on the challenge of programming one of the game's mini-bosses, the Queen Bee, implemented floating platforms, achievements and part of the altiu's behaviour (Shield Knight's trusted owl)
