[{"content":"In Shovel Knight Dig, I delved into serious UI programming for the first time. Localization added another layer of complexity, this experience taught me the importance of considering localization from the project\u0026rsquo;s inception and maintaining a clean, decoupled project structure for smoother development.\nCollaborating with a skilled UI designer, I received mockups and assets, fostering a valuable feedback loop. This collaborative effort highlighted the significance of effective teamwork in game development.\n[ADD UI VIDEO]\nIn addition to tackling UI programming, I took on the challenge of programming one of the game\u0026rsquo;s mini-bosses, the Queen Bee, implemented floating platforms, achievements and part of the altiu\u0026rsquo;s behaviour (Shield Knight\u0026rsquo;s trusted owl)\n[ADD IMAGE GALLERY OF THESE]\n","date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/shovel-knight-dig/cover_hu7ca7faed8faaa9f73da67f7370aed27f_314718_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/shovel-knight-dig/","title":"Shovel Knight Dig"},{"content":"In Capture, a university project, I worked as the game designer and producer. Collaborating with 2 teammates, we created a first-person puzzle game centered around taking pictures to solve challenges. The unique mechanics drew inspiration from The Witness and \u0026ldquo;picture modes\u0026rdquo; present in games. We also successfully presented the game at various cons, winning a pitch competition at Comic Con and winning an award for Best Art, and being nominated for Best Game at the PlayStation Awards Portugal. This project highlighted my skills in conceptualizing unconventional game mechanics and managing the production process.\nCheck the game out on itch-io\n","date":"2022-03-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/capture/cover_hu78301b88e3f4df9f3d9352d330f7ef96_765485_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/capture/","title":"Capture"},{"content":"Motivated by a desire for diverse learning experiences, Neokai emerged as a third-year project with the same collaborators from Capture. Seeking a stark contrast to our previous endeavor, we ventured into the development of a top-down competitive online shooter. My roles as a Producer, Game and UI designer, coupled with Gameplay Programming, allowed me to engage in character game design, player testing, and balancing. This project served as a deliberate exploration into a completely different genre, reinforcing the importance of adaptability and comprehensive project planning in game development.\nCheck the game out on itch-io\n","date":"2022-03-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/neokai/cover_huee4c29a7b3b3ae939791807f7226a465_17870_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/neokai/","title":"Neokai"},{"content":"Spike is a personal project, 2v2 volleyball game influenced by fighting games.

The platformer\u0026rsquo;s unique concept involved juggling a ball as the sole light source. The focus on a small, polished portion taught me the value of simplicity in game jam projects. Although reflecting on it now, I would tweak the movement/juggling mechanics, the experience greatly influenced my current work on a work in progres project with similar mechanics.\nCheck the game out on itch-io\n","date":"2022-03-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/only-one-light/cover_hu3a9f4d35783bc53408b0e467eb65719e_37334_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://joaosilvadev.github.io/portfolio/p/only-one-light/","title":"Only One Light"},{"content":"Terry\u0026rsquo;s Tragedy, a winning entry in the Weekly Game Jam, explored the theme \u0026ldquo;you are the villain.\u0026rdquo; In this top-down grid turn-based puzzle game, players navigate levels with the challenge of reaching an exit without causing harm to bystanders, leading to increased police aggression.
